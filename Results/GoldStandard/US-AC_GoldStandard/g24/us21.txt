User Story: 
As a depositor, I want to allow others to deposit on my behalf, so that I can delegate research data management tasks appropriately.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. The system has an option for depositor to grant permission to other users to deposit.
2. The depositor should be able to manage the permission: access level of the user (deposit-only, both deposit and delete); access type of data.
3. The delegated users should be able to perform deposit data as specified.
4. The deposited information should be automatically sent to both depositor and the delegator.
5. The delegated task should be notified to the delegator.
6. The progress of delgated task should be periodically updated to the depositor and the delegator.
7. The depositor can delegate multiple users on the same task, and the depositor can set different access level for these users.
8. If multiple deposit tasks are being conducted, the system must handle the conflicts, such as prompting warning that others are performing task on this dataset.
9. The depositor should be able to revoke the granted permission.
