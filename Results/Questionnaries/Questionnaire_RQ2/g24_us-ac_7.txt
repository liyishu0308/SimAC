User Story: 
As a depositor, I want to have guarantees about data integrity, so that I can use my data in the future and I can fulfil funder requirements for archival.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #1)
1. The system should implement data validation measures to ensure the accuracy and integrity of depositor data.
2. When data is entered or modified, the system should perform validation checks to ensure the data conforms to defined rules and standards.
3. The system should prevent the storage of incomplete or inconsistent data.
4. The system should have appropriate error handling mechanisms to handle data validation errors and provide clear error messages to users.
5. The system should implement data backup and recovery mechanisms to protect against data loss or corruption.
6. The system should provide an audit trail functionality allowing depositor to track changes made to their data.
7. The system should adhere to industry best practices and standards for data integrity, such as checksums or hash functions, to ensure the integrity of stored data.
8. The system should conduct periodic integrity checks on stored data to identify and correct any data corruption or inconsistencies.
9. The system should provide data export functionality in common formats to fulfill funder requirements for archival.
10. The system should provide documentation on data integrity measures and procedures for the depositor to comply with funder requirements.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #2)
1. The system should ensure the accuracy and completeness of all deposited data.
2. The system should have measures in place to detect and prevent data corruption and tampering.
3. The system should provide a secure and reliable storage solution to protect the data from loss or unauthorized access.
4. The system should implement version control mechanisms to track and manage changes to the deposited data.
5. The system should adhere to industry standards and best practices for data archiving and ensure compliance with funder requirements.
6. The system should generate checksums or hash values for each deposited data file to ensure data integrity during storage and retrieval.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #3)
1. All data stored in the system should be protected against accidental loss, corruption, or unauthorized modification.
2. The system should provide mechanisms to ensure the integrity of data during storage, transmission, and retrieval processes.
3. Data backups should be performed regularly to enable data recovery in case of any failures or disasters.
4. The system should implement access controls to prevent unauthorized access or modifications to the data.
5. The system should have a version control mechanism to track and manage changes made to the data over time.
6. The system should comply with industry standards and best practices for data integrity and archival, such as checksum verification and long-term data preservation.
