3. The interruption method should be displayed to the volunteer based on the defined rules when the condition is met.
4. The interruption method should be clear and easily understandable to the volunteer.
5. The admin should be able to track the effectiveness of different interruption methods through analytics or feedback from the volunteers.
6. The system should provide a way for the admin to easily update and modify the interruption rules and methods.
