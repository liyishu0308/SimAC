User Story: 
As an academicpublisher, I want to make persistent web links between my articles and underlying datasets, so that my journals can be seen to be filled with robust, high quality research. 

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #1)
1. The web links between articles and underlying datasets should be created in a way that ensures their persistence over time.
2. The web links should be easily accessible and clearly visible within the articles.
3. Clicking on a web link should direct the user to the corresponding dataset.
4. The web links should be updated or corrected if the underlying dataset location changes or if the dataset becomes unavailable.
5. The web links should be tested to ensure that they work correctly and consistently across different browsers and devices.
6. The web links should be standardized and follow industry best practices to ensure interoperability and compatibility with other systems and platforms.
7. The creation and maintenance of the web links between articles and datasets should be automated whenever possible to reduce manual overhead and potential errors.
8. The system should provide a way for users to report broken or incorrect web links so that they can be promptly addressed and fixed.
9. The web links should be included in the metadata of the articles to facilitate discoverability and indexing by search engines and other scholarly platforms.
10. The persistence and integrity of the web links should be regularly monitored and tested to ensure they continue to function as intended.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #2)
1. The system should support the establishment of persistent web links between articles and underlying datasets.
2. The persistent web links should be easily accessible and visible within the article.
3. Clicking on a persistent web link should direct the user to the corresponding dataset.
4. The persistent web links should be unique and not interfere with any other page or link within the website.
5. The establishment of persistent web links should be supported for all articles published by the academic publisher.
6. The system should provide a mechanism for the publisher to manage and update the persistent web links if necessary.
7. The persistent web links should comply with any industry standards or best practices for linking articles and datasets.
8. The system should validate the URL format of the persistent web links and display an error message if an invalid URL is provided.
9. The system should enforce proper authentication and authorization for accessing the datasets through the persistent web links, ensuring only authorized users can view the data.
10. The system should log and track any errors or failures encountered while establishing or accessing the persistent web links.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #3)
1. The system should provide a feature to create persistent web links between articles and underlying datasets.
2. The persistent web links should be generated automatically and remain consistent even if the location of the dataset changes.
3. The persistent web links should be publicly accessible and should not require any login or authentication.
4. The persistent web links should be associated with the specific article and dataset, ensuring accurate linking between the two.
5. The persistent web links should be easily shareable and should be compatible with various communication channels (e.g., email, social media).
6. The persistent web links should be visually distinguishable from regular hyperlinks to clearly indicate their purpose.
7. The persistent web links should be supported by a reliable hosting infrastructure to ensure continuous availability and access.
8. The persistent web links should be compatible across different devices, operating systems, and web browsers.
9. The system should track and record usage statistics of the persistent web links to provide analytics on the popularity and impact of the articles and datasets.
10. The persistent web links should be encrypted and secure to protect sensitive information and maintain data integrity.
11. The system should support version management of the datasets to handle updates or changes without breaking the persistent web links.
