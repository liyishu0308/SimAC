User Story: 
As an academicpublisher, I want to make persistent web links between my articles and underlying datasets, so that my journals can be seen to be filled with robust, high quality research. 

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #1)
1. The system should provide a functionality to create persistent web links between articles and underlying datasets.
2. The persistent web links should be unique and permanent, ensuring that they do not change or become obsolete over time.
3. The persistent web links should be easily accessible and visible within the article, allowing readers to easily navigate to the underlying datasets.
4. The persistent web links should be clickable and direct the user to the specific dataset mentioned in the article.
5. The system should validate that the dataset being linked actually exists and is accessible before creating the persistent web link.
6. The persistent web links should be customizable, allowing the publisher to define the format and naming convention of the links.
7. The persistent web links should be securely stored and encrypted to protect the integrity and accessibility of the linked datasets.
8. The system should track and log any changes or updates made to the persistent web links, providing an audit trail for reference.
9. The persistent web links should be compatible with different web browsers and devices, ensuring a seamless user experience for readers.
10. The system should provide an option to easily remove or update the persistent web links if needed in case of changes or corrections to the article or dataset.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #2)
1. The system should provide a feature to create persistent web links between articles and underlying datasets.
2. The persistent web links should be generated automatically and remain consistent even if the location of the dataset changes.
3. The persistent web links should be publicly accessible and should not require any login or authentication.
4. The persistent web links should be associated with the specific article and dataset, ensuring accurate linking between the two.
5. The persistent web links should be easily shareable and should be compatible with various communication channels (e.g., email, social media).
6. The persistent web links should be visually distinguishable from regular hyperlinks to clearly indicate their purpose.
7. The persistent web links should be supported by a reliable hosting infrastructure to ensure continuous availability and access.
8. The persistent web links should be compatible across different devices, operating systems, and web browsers.
9. The system should track and record usage statistics of the persistent web links to provide analytics on the popularity and impact of the articles and datasets.
10. The persistent web links should be encrypted and secure to protect sensitive information and maintain data integrity.
11. The system should support version management of the datasets to handle updates or changes without breaking the persistent web links.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #3)
1. The academic publisher must be able to create a permanent link between an article and an underlying dataset.
2. The link should be displayed prominently on the article page.
3. The link should direct users to the dataset's page.
4. The link should function properly across all major browsers.
5. The link must be secure and not be accessible to unauthorized parties.
6. The link should be persistent and not be changed or removed without explicit authorization.
7. The link should be clearly visible and labeled.
8. The link should be clickable for easy access to the dataset.
9. The link should be valid for the lifetime of the article.
10. The performance of the link should be monitored regularly to ensure its reliability.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #4)
1. The user should be able to link an article to an existing dataset.
2. The link between the article and the dataset should be persistent and not be broken.
3. The link should be visible on the article page and the dataset page.
4. The link should be visible to all users.
5. The linked dataset should be searchable by keywords.
6. The link should be securely encrypted and protected from malicious access.
