User Story: 
As a depositor, I want to allow my collaborators privileged access to datasets, so that we continue to have a productive relationship.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #1)
1. The application should provide a feature for the depositor to grant privileged access to datasets to specific collaborators.
2. Collaborators should be able to request access to datasets, which will then be reviewed and approved by the depositor.
3. The depositor should be able to define the level of privilege/access that each collaborator has for each dataset (e.g., view-only, edit, download, etc.).
4. The application should provide a user-friendly interface for the depositor to manage and modify access privileges for collaborators.
5. Collaborators should receive notifications when their access requests are approved, denied, or modified.
6. The application should enforce security measures to ensure that only approved collaborators can access the datasets they have been granted privileges for.
7. Collaborators should be able to easily access the datasets they have privileged access to through their user accounts.
8. The depositor should have the ability to revoke or modify access privileges for collaborators at any time.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #2)
1. The depositor should have the ability to grant access to specific datasets to selected collaborators.
2. The system should provide a user interface for the depositor to manage and modify the privileges of the collaborators.
3. The depositor should be able to assign different levels of access privileges to the collaborators, such as read-only access or read-write access.
4. The collaborators should receive notifications or alerts when their access privileges are modified or when new datasets are shared with them.
5. The system should enforce access control measures to prevent unauthorized access to datasets by collaborators.
6. The system should provide the option for granular permission settings, allowing the depositor to define access at the file or folder level.
7. The system should have a backup and recovery mechanism in place to protect the datasets in case of accidental loss or corruption.
8. The system should have the ability to revoke access privileges for a collaborator if necessary.
9. The system should allow the depositor to set restrictions on specific datasets, such as restricting access based on time or location.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #3)
1. The user should be able to access the page to grant access to the datasets.
2. The user should be able to select one or more collaborators to grant access to the dataset.
3. The user should be able to specify the access level for each collaborator.
4. The user should be able to revoke access to the dataset for any collaborator.
5. The user should receive a notification email after granting access to the dataset.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #4)
1. The depositor should be able to grant permission to view or edit datasets to other users.
2. The depositor should be able to specify the type of access they grant (e.g. read-only, edit, etc.).
3. The depositor should be able to view a list of users with access to their datasets.
4. The system should prevent the depositor from granting more privileged access than they possess.
5. The system should prevent the depositor from granting access to users who are not registered in the system.
6. The system should send notifications to the depositor when access is granted or revoked.
7. The system should have an audit trail of all access granted and revoked.
