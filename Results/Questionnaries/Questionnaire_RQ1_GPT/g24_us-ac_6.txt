6. The DOI should be clickable, allowing the user to copy or share it easily.
7. The DOI link should be valid and lead to the correct dataset.
8. The dataset landing page should allow users to download or import the dataset into their reference management software automatically.
9. The DOI should persist over time, ensuring that users can access the dataset even if the original webpage or documentation changes or becomes unavailable.
10. The dataset provider should have a mechanism in place to update or resolve any broken DOI links or errors that may occur.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #2)
