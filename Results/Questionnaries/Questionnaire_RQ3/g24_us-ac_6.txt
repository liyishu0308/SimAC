4. The DOI should be a valid DOI format, following the standards set by the International DOI Foundation.
5. The DOI should be automatically generated and assigned to each dataset upon submission.
6. The DOI should remain the same for a given dataset, even if any changes are made to the dataset details.
7. The DOI should be accessible and visible for all users with appropriate permissions.
8. The DOI should not contain any sensitive or confidential information.
9. The DOI should be searchable within the system, allowing users to search by DOI to find specific datasets.
10. If a dataset does not have a DOI, an error message should be displayed indicating that no DOI is available.
11. Clicking on the DOI should not result in any errors or broken links.
12. When importing the DOI into reference management software, the dataset should be properly imported with all relevant metadata.
13. The DOI should be displayed in a persistent manner, even if the user navigates away from the dataset page and then returns to it.
14. The DOI should be displayed on all pages where the dataset is referenced, including search results and related dataset listings.
15. The system should provide a way to manage and update DOIs, in case a dataset needs a new or updated DOI.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #2)
1. The user should be able to access the DOI (Digital Object Identifier) for a dataset on the platform.
2. Upon opening the dataset, the DOI should be clearly visible and identifiable, preferably located in a prominent position such as the dataset header or metadata section.

4. The DOI should be clickable, allowing the user to copy it to the clipboard or open it in a separate tab or window for further reference.
5. The platform should provide a mechanism for the user to easily import the dataset into their reference management software using the DOI.
6. The imported dataset in the reference management software should have accurate and complete metadata associated with it, including the title, authors, publication date, and any other relevant information.
7. The DOI should remain valid and accessible even if the dataset is updated or modified in the future.
8. The system should generate a unique DOI for each dataset and ensure that DOI collisions or duplicates do not occur.
9. The DOI should be easily accessible and visible on mobile devices or smaller screens.
10. There should be a user-friendly interface or tooltip that provides information on what a DOI is and how it can be used for referencing and citation of the dataset.
11. The DOI link should redirect the user to the latest version of the dataset, even if multiple versions exist.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #3)
1. The user should be able to view a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) for a dataset.
2. The DOI should be clearly displayed on the dataset's information page or metadata.
3. Clicking on the DOI should direct the user to the landing page or repository where the dataset is hosted.
4. The DOI should be persistent and unique, ensuring that it remains accessible for future reference.
5. The user should be able to easily copy the DOI to their clipboard or export it for use in reference management software.
6. The DOI should follow the standard DOI format and conventions.
7. The dataset should include the necessary metadata required to generate a DOI, such as title, author(s), publication date, and version information if applicable.
8. The DOI should be searchable and discoverable through relevant DOI search platforms or databases.
9. The dataset's landing page or repository should provide compatibility information regarding reference management software that can import the dataset using the DOI.
10. The application should provide an option to automatically import the DOI and relevant metadata into reference management software.
11. The DOI should be associated with the exact version of the dataset used, to ensure reproducibility and prevent confusion.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #4)
1. The dataset should have a unique DOI (Digital Object Identifier) assigned to it.
2. The DOI for the dataset should be prominently displayed on the dataset's webpage or documentation.
3. The DOI should be in a clickable format, allowing the user to easily copy or open the DOI link.
4. Clicking on the DOI should redirect the user to the dataset's landing page or a dedicated page providing detailed information about the dataset.
5. The DOI should be persistent and remain functional for an extended period to ensure long-term accessibility and traceability of the dataset.
6. The DOI should comply with the standards and guidelines for DOI naming and formatting.
7. The DOI should be compatible with reference management software, allowing users to import the dataset automatically by simply entering or pasting the DOI into their software.
8. The DOI should be documented and made available to users in a clear and easily accessible manner, such as on the dataset's webpage, documentation, or metadata.
9. The DOI should be associated with appropriate metadata, including the title, author(s), publication date, and any other relevant information about the dataset, enabling users to identify and reference the dataset accurately.
10. The dataset's landing page or dedicated page should provide options for downloading the dataset in different file formats, facilitating easy access and use of the data.
11. The DOI should be machine-readable and accessible through an API or service for programmatic retrieval and integration with other tools or systems.
