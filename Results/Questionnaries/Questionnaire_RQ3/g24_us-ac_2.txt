11. The persistent URL should support different versions of the dataset, allowing users to access specific versions if needed.
12. The system should provide a notification or warning if the persistent URL will expire or become invalid.
13. The system should provide a persistent URL (PRD-1) for each dataset that is created.
14. The persistent URL (PRD-1) should be unique and remain unchanged over time.
15. The persistent URL (PRD-1) should be easily accessible and clickable for users.
16. The persistent URL (PRD-1) should redirect users to the correct dataset when clicked.
17. The persistent URL (PRD-1) should be sharable, allowing users to easily share the URL with others.
18. The persistent URL (PRD-1) should remain valid even if the dataset is moved or renamed.
19. The system should track and log any changes made to the persistent URL (PRD-1).
20. The persistent URL (PRD-1) should comply with best practices for URL naming conventions and should not contain any unsupported characters.
21. The system should include a version management feature that allows users to access previous versions of the dataset through the persistent URL (PRD-1).
22. The system should implement code management practices to ensure the persistent URL (PRD-1) is properly integrated and maintained.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #2)
1. The user should be able to generate a persistent URL for a dataset that they want to reuse.
2. The generated URL should be unique and remain accessible for an extended period.
3. The persistent URL should lead directly to the dataset and not require any additional steps for accessing the data.
4. The URL should be easy to copy or share with others for future reference.
5. The persistent URL should be independent of any changes to the dataset, such as updates or modifications.
6. The persistent URL should be compatible with different browsers and devices to ensure broad accessibility.
7. The user should be able to retrieve the dataset data by simply clicking on the persistent URL.
8. The persistent URL should provide a method to download the dataset in a common, widely-supported format.
9. The system should store the persistent URL securely to protect the privacy and integrity of the dataset.
10. The user should have the ability to expire or revoke the persistent URL if needed.
11. The persistent URL should be tested for scalability to handle a large number of datasets and concurrent users.
12. The system should track the usage and accessibility of the persistent URLs for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes.
13. The user should receive notification when the dataset associated with the persistent URL is updated.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #3)
1. The user should be able to generate a persistent URL for a dataset from the application.
2. The persistent URL should be unique and not change over time.
3. The persistent URL should be easily recognizable and human-readable.
4. The persistent URL should be shareable and accessible by other users.
5. Clicking on the persistent URL should direct the user to the corresponding dataset.
6. The persistent URL should be valid and functional even after a long period of time.
7. The persistent URL should not expose any sensitive or confidential data.
8. The application should track the usage of persistent URLs to monitor any potential issues or errors.
9. The persistent URL should have version management, allowing access to different versions of the dataset if applicable.
10. The application should provide an option to manually or automatically renew the persistent URL to ensure continued accessibility to the dataset.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #4)
1. The system should provide a persistent URL for each dataset that is generated and accessible to data reusers.
2. The persistent URL should be unique and remain unchanged over time, even if the dataset is updated or modified.
3. The persistent URL should be easily visible and accessible on the dataset page or within the dataset information.
4. Clicking on the persistent URL should directly lead the data reuser to the dataset without requiring any additional authentication or authorization steps.
5. The persistent URL should be shareable, allowing data reusers to easily share the link with others.
6. The persistent URL should be valid and accessible for a long period of time, ensuring that data reusers can reliably return to the dataset in the future.
7. The persistent URL should be designed to be human-readable and intuitive, providing meaningful information about the dataset or its content.
8. The system should regularly monitor and validate the availability and accessibility of persistent URLs, proactively addressing any issues and ensuring that data reusers can always access the datasets using the persistent URLs.
