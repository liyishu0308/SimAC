User Story: 
As an academicpublisher, I want to make persistent web links between my articles and underlying datasets, so that my journals can be seen to be filled with robust, high quality research. 

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #1)
1. The system should provide a functionality to create persistent web links between articles and datasets.
2. The persistent web links should be unique and unchangeable once created.
3. The persistent web links should be accessible and functional for the lifetime of the articles and datasets.
4. The persistent web links should direct the users to the corresponding datasets.
5. The system should ensure that the datasets linked to the articles are of high quality and meet the standards set by the academic publisher.
6. The system should provide an option to update or remove the persistent web links if needed.
7. The system should generate an error message if a persistent web link is invalid or broken.
8. The system should provide an option to export and import persistent web links for backup and migration purposes.
9. The persistent web links should support different formats of datasets, such as PDF, CSV, and Excel.
10. The persistent web links should be secure and not accessible to unauthorized users.
11. The system should notify the users if there are any updates or changes to the linked datasets.
12. The system should have a mechanism to verify and validate the integrity of the persistent web links regularly to ensure they are not broken or outdated.
13. The system should have a backup system in place to restore the persistent web links in case of data loss or system failure.
14. The system should have a release plan for introducing the persistent web links feature.
15. The persistent web links should be stored securely and protected from unauthorized access.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #2)
1. The system should have a feature to create persistent web links between articles and underlying datasets.
2. The web links should be easily accessible and visible to readers of the articles.
3. When a dataset is linked to an article, the link should be prominently displayed near the relevant section or figure in the article.
4. The web links should be persistent, meaning that they should remain active and functional even if the location or name of the dataset is changed.
5. The system should support the ability to update or modify the web links if there are any changes to the underlying datasets.
6. The system should provide the option to automatically generate web links based on predefined rules or metadata associated with the datasets.
7. The system should support multiple formats for the web links, such as URLs or QR codes, to accommodate different user preferences and accessibility needs.
8. The web links should include proper error-handling mechanisms, displaying informative messages to users if the linked datasets are no longer available or accessible.
9. The system should support version management for the linked datasets, allowing publishers to replace old versions with new versions while still maintaining the link integrity.
10. The system should provide analytics to track the number of clicks, views, and downloads of the linked datasets, helping the publisher to assess the impact and popularity of the research.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #3)
1. The system should provide a feature to create persistent web links between articles and underlying datasets.
2. The persistent web links should be generated automatically and remain consistent even if the location of the dataset changes.
3. The persistent web links should be publicly accessible and should not require any login or authentication.
4. The persistent web links should be associated with the specific article and dataset, ensuring accurate linking between the two.
5. The persistent web links should be easily shareable and should be compatible with various communication channels (e.g., email, social media).
6. The persistent web links should be visually distinguishable from regular hyperlinks to clearly indicate their purpose.
7. The persistent web links should be supported by a reliable hosting infrastructure to ensure continuous availability and access.
8. The persistent web links should be compatible across different devices, operating systems, and web browsers.
9. The system should track and record usage statistics of the persistent web links to provide analytics on the popularity and impact of the articles and datasets.
10. The persistent web links should be encrypted and secure to protect sensitive information and maintain data integrity.
11. The system should support version management of the datasets to handle updates or changes without breaking the persistent web links.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #4)
1. The system should provide a feature to create persistent web links between articles and underlying datasets.
2. The persistent web links should be visible and easily accessible from within the article.
3. Clicking on the persistent web link should redirect the user to the underlying dataset, providing additional information and context.
4. The persistent web links should be reliable and should consistently direct the user to the correct dataset, even if the dataset has been moved or renamed.
5. The persistent web links should conform to industry standards for URL structure and should be user-friendly and easy to understand.
6. The system should support creating and managing multiple persistent web links for each article, allowing for flexibility and multiple references to different datasets.
7. The persistent web links should be secure and only accessible to authorized users, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of the linked datasets.
8. The system should track and log the usage of persistent web links, providing metrics and insights into the popularity and impact of the linked datasets.
9. The system should provide the ability to automatically update the persistent web links in case of changes to the underlying datasets (e.g., if the dataset is updated or replaced).
10. The persistent web links should be easily shareable via email or social media platforms, allowing researchers to promote their work and datasets.
