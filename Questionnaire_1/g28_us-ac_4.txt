2. The filter options should include aspects related to audio and video quality such as resolution, bitrate, audio clarity, etc.
3. The admin should be able to select multiple filter options to narrow down the search results.
4. The ranking feature should prioritize videos with higher A/V quality based on the selected filter options.
5. The ranking should be displayed in a clear and easily understandable manner, such as a numerical score or a star rating.
6. The filtered and ranked videos should be displayed in a list or grid format, with their A/V quality information clearly visible.
7. The admin should have the ability to modify or update the A/V quality aspects for each video manually if needed.
8. The filtering and ranking process should be fast and efficient, even with a large number of videos in the database.
9. The filtering and ranking feature should be thoroughly tested with different combinations of filter options to ensure accurate results.
10. The ranking algorithm should be validated to ensure that it accurately reflects the A/V quality of the videos and consistently produces reliable results.
11. The video filtering and ranking feature should support pagination to display a limited number of videos per page.
12. The admin should have the option to apply default or saved filter configurations for quick access to commonly used filtering options.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #4)
1. The admin should have access to a filter or search functionality specifically designed for filtering and ranking videos based on A/V quality aspects.
2. The filter or search functionality should allow the admin to filter videos based on specific quality aspects, such as resolution, frame rate, bit rate, audio quality, and encoding format.
3. The filter or search functionality should provide options for the admin to set a minimum or maximum threshold for each quality aspect.
4. When the admin applies the filter or search, the system should display a list of videos that meet the selected criteria and rank them based on the overall A/V quality.
5. The ranking should be based on a set of predefined criteria or algorithm that takes into account the importance of each quality aspect.
6. The filter or search functionality should be validated to ensure that it accurately filters and ranks videos based on the specified quality aspects.
7. The interface for viewing A/V quality details should be tested to ensure that it presents the information clearly and accurately for each video in the filtered or ranked list.
