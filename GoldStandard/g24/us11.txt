User Story: 
As a depositor, I want to have metadata automatically filled from other University systems and remembered from previous deposits, so that I don't have to waste time reentering the same information.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. The system should provide the option of "Retrieve data" when the depositor filling the forms.
2. The depositor should be able to choose retrieve from other universities or from previous deposits.
3. Once options selected, the system should retrieve metadata automatically from other University systems or existing systems.
4. The automatically retrieved metadata should be mapped and automatically filled in the deposit form.
5. For other information that cannot be automatically retrieved, it should be highlighted and request the depositor to enter the details manually.
6. The pre-filled metadata should be editable in case the depositor wants to make changes or updates.
7. The depositor should be able to remember current deposit for future retrieve.
8. The authentication process from other universities should be secure, following the agreed standard.
