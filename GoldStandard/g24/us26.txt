User Story: 
As a data reuser, I want to view a DOI for a dataset, so that I can get back to the data in future and I can import the dataset into my referencemanagement software automatically.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. The DOI for each dataset should be clearly displayed in the landing page of the dataset.
2. When the user searching the dataset, the DOI should be displayed in its result page as parts of the description of the dataset.
3. The user should be able to search the relevant dataset via the DOI.
4. The user should be able to copy the DOI to clipboard or export it for its usage in reference management software.
5. There should be information icon next to the DOI, which provides brief instructions or tooltips explaining how to use the DOI for citing the dataset or importing it into reference management software.
6. The display of the DOI follows recognized standards (e.g., "https://doi.org/[DOI]") to ensure consistency and recognizability for users.
7. The metadata associated with the DOI (e.g., dataset title, author(s), publication date) is accurate and up-to-date.
8. The DOI is provided in a format that is compatible with major reference management software (e.g., EndNote, Zotero, Mendeley), allowing users to import dataset citations directly into their reference libraries with the DOI.
