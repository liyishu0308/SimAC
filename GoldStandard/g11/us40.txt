User Story: 
As a developer, I want to know what the three initial hypotheses are, so that I can plan work around development of prototypes.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. The three initial hypotheses should be clearly documented.
2. The developer should be able to access the three initial hypothesis.
3. The system should provide Q&A session to assist with the developer to understand the hypotheses.
4. The hypothese should be clearly stated with problem statement, proposed solution, and expected outcome. If possible, examples should be provided.
5. The hypotheses should be prioritized.
6. A brief overview of the expected prototype for each hypothesis should be provided, including key features, functionalities, or user interactions that need to be explored.
