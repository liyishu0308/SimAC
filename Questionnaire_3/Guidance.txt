****Backgrounds**********************************************************
Questionnaire for the effectiveness of different models in the task of User Story Completion.
The complete user story with acceptance criteria is marked as "US-AC".

Please score each US-AC by the five attributes of INVEST evaluation criteria.
The score of each attribute is 0 to 4.
0 = US-AC fulfilled the X attribute poorly.
1 = US-AC fulfilled the X attribute unsatisfactorily.
2 = US-AC fulfilled the X attribute to some extent.
3 = US-AC fulfilled the X attribute satisfactorily.
4 = US-AC fulfilled the X attribute very satisfactorily.

INVEST evaluation attributes:
Attribute 1 (Independent): The US-AC should be as independent as possible. It can be worked on in any order. It allows for true prioritization of each and every story. 
Attribute 2 (Negotiable): The US-AC is not an explicit contract and should leave space for discussion. It can be rewritten, depending on business, market, technical or any other type of requirement by team members.
Attribute 3 (Valuable): A US-AC must deliver value to the stakeholders.
Attribute 4 (Estimable): The US-AC should be estimable. It is well enough understood by team members to be able to determine its relative size (in development and cost).
Attribute 5 (Small): The US-AC should not be so big as to become impossible to plan/task/prioritize within a level of accuracy.
Attribute 6 (Testable): A US-AC must provide the necessary information to make test development possible.

The generations for different models are randomly ordered.
And US-ACs are randomly picked from 3 projects (e.g., g11, g24, g28).

Brief description of three projects:
g11 - New version of the NSF website: redesign and content discover.
g24 - Institutional data repository for the University of Bath.
g28 - Citizen science platform that allows anyone to help in research tasks.
