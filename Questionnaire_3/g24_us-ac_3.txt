User Story: 
As a depositor, I want to allow my collaborators privileged access to datasets, so that we continue to have a productive relationship.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #1)
1. The depositor should have the ability to grant access to specific datasets to selected collaborators.
2. The system should provide a user interface for the depositor to manage and modify the privileges of the collaborators.
3. The depositor should be able to assign different levels of access privileges to the collaborators, such as read-only access or read-write access.
4. The collaborators should receive notifications or alerts when their access privileges are modified or when new datasets are shared with them.
5. The system should enforce access control measures to prevent unauthorized access to datasets by collaborators.
6. The system should provide the option for granular permission settings, allowing the depositor to define access at the file or folder level.
7. The system should have a backup and recovery mechanism in place to protect the datasets in case of accidental loss or corruption.
8. The system should have the ability to revoke access privileges for a collaborator if necessary.
9. The system should allow the depositor to set restrictions on specific datasets, such as restricting access based on time or location.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #2)
1. The depositor should have the ability to grant access to specific datasets to selected collaborators.
2. The system should track and log the activities of the collaborators for auditing purposes.
3. The collaborators should receive notifications or alerts when their access privileges are modified or when new datasets are shared with them.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #3)

2. The system should provide a user interface for the depositor to manage and modify the privileges of the collaborators.
3. The collaborators should receive notifications or alerts when their access privileges are modified or when new datasets are shared with them.
