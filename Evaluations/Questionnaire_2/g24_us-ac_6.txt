User Story: 
As a data reuser, I want to view a DOI for a dataset, so that I can get back to the data in future and I can import the dataset into my referencemanagement software automatically.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #1)
1. The user should be able to access the dataset page on the data repository platform.
2. On the dataset page, there should be a prominently displayed Digital Object Identifier (DOI).
3. The DOI should be clickable, leading the user to a landing page where they can view detailed metadata and other information about the dataset.
4. The DOI should be formatted correctly according to the DOI system standards.
5. The DOI should be unique and persistent, ensuring that it can be used to access the dataset even if its location or URL changes.
6. The user should be able to copy the DOI to their clipboard easily for future reference.
7. The user should be able to import the dataset into their reference management software by using the DOI, which automatically populates the relevant citation details.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #2)
1. The user should be able to access the dataset details page.
2. The dataset details page should display a unique DOI (Digital Object Identifier) for the dataset.
3. The DOI should be prominently displayed and easy to copy or download.
4. Clicking on the DOI should open a new tab or window with the dataset's landing page on the relevant DOI resolver service.
5. The DOI resolver should provide a persistent link to the dataset that can be used to access the dataset in the future.
6. The dataset information should include the necessary metadata required by reference management software for automatic import.
7. The DOI should be formatted in a standard DOI format (e.g., "10.xxxx/xxxxx") to ensure compatibility and interoperability with other systems.
8. The DOI resolver service should have appropriate security measures in place to protect the privacy and security of the dataset and user information.
9. The DOI should be valid and active, ensuring that it is not expired or revoked.
