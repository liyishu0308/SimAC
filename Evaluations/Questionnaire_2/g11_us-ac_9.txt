User Story: 
As a developer, I want to know what the three initial hypotheses are, so that I can plan work around development of prototypes.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #1)
1. There should be a clear and centralized documentation or artifact that lists the three initial hypotheses.
2. Each hypothesis should be clearly stated, with a description of the problem or opportunity being addressed.
