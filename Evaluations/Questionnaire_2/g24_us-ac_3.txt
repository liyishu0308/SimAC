User Story: 
As a depositor, I want to allow my collaborators privileged access to datasets, so that we continue to have a productive relationship.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #1)
1. The depositor should be able to invite collaborators to access datasets.
2. Collaborators should receive an invitation email with a link to set up their privileged access.
3. The invitation email should clearly state the purpose and scope of the collaboration.
4. Collaborators should be able to set up their privileged access by following the link in the invitation email.
5. Collaborators should be able to log in to their accounts using the privilege access credentials provided.
6. Collaborators should only have access to the datasets specified by the depositor.
7. The depositor should have the ability to revoke or modify the privileged access of collaborators.
8. Collaborators should receive notifications when their privileged access is modified or revoked.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #2)
1. The depositor should be able to invite collaborators by providing their email addresses or usernames.
2. Collaborators should receive an email notification or an in-app notification with an invitation link to access the datasets.
3. Collaborators should have the ability to accept or decline the invitation to access the datasets.
4. If the invitation is accepted, collaborators should be granted privileged access to the datasets specified by the depositor.
5. The depositor should have the ability to specify the level of access and permissions for each collaborator, such as read-only access or edit access.
6. The depositor should have the ability to revoke access for any collaborator at any time.
7. When access is revoked, collaborators should no longer have the ability to view or interact with the datasets.
8. The platform should ensure secure and encrypted communication between the depositor and collaborators during the invitation and access management process.
9. The notification system should be reliable and ensure that collaborators receive the invitation notifications in a timely manner.
10. The platform should track and log all actions related to collaboration, including invitation sent, acceptance/decline, access level changes, and access revocation.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #3)
1. The depositor should have the ability to grant access to specific datasets to selected collaborators.
2. The system should provide a user interface for the depositor to manage and modify the privileges of the collaborators.
3. The depositor should be able to assign different levels of access privileges to the collaborators, such as read-only access or read-write access.
4. The collaborators should receive notifications or alerts when their access privileges are modified or when new datasets are shared with them.
5. The system should enforce access control measures to prevent unauthorized access to datasets by collaborators.
6. The system should provide the option for granular permission settings, allowing the depositor to define access at the file or folder level.
7. The system should have a backup and recovery mechanism in place to protect the datasets in case of accidental loss or corruption.
8. The system should have the ability to revoke access privileges for a collaborator if necessary.
9. The system should allow the depositor to set restrictions on specific datasets, such as restricting access based on time or location.
