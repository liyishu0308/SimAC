User Story: 
As a depositor, I want to have metadata automatically filled from other University systems and remembered from previous deposits, so that I don't have to waste time reentering the same information.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #1)
1. When a depositor initiates a new deposit, the system should automatically retrieve metadata from other connected University systems, such as the student information system or research system.
2. The retrieved metadata should be displayed on the deposit form for the depositor to review and confirm.
3. The system should remember the metadata from previous deposits and pre-fill them on subsequent deposit forms for the same depositor.
4. The depositor should have the ability to edit the pre-filled metadata if needed.
5. The system should track any changes made to pre-filled metadata to ensure accuracy and accountability.
6. The depositor should be able to easily identify which fields are pre-filled with metadata and which fields require manual entry.
7. The system should provide clear and concise error messages if any issues are encountered with retrieving or saving metadata.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #2)
1. When filling out a deposit form, the system should automatically populate fields such as name, email, and affiliation by retrieving relevant information from other university systems.
2. If the system is unable to retrieve metadata from other systems, the user should have the option to manually enter this information.
3. The system should remember and pre-fill previously entered metadata for repeat depositors to save time and reduce redundant data entry.
4. The system should validate the accuracy and completeness of the automatically filled metadata, and notify the user if any discrepancies or missing information are detected.
5. The user should be able to review and edit the automatically filled metadata before submitting the deposit form.
6. The system should securely store and protect the user's metadata to ensure privacy and data security.
7. The system should handle cases where the user's metadata has changed since the last deposit, and prompt the user to update the information.
8. The system should handle cases where the user wishes to clear the pre-filled metadata and start fresh with manual entry.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #3)
1. The system should be able to retrieve metadata automatically from other University systems, such as student information system and HR database, when a depositor starts a new deposit.
2. The automatically retrieved metadata should include the necessary and relevant information for the deposit process, such as name, ID, affiliation, department, and contact information.
3. If the system is unable to retrieve any metadata from other University systems, the depositor should be prompted to manually enter the missing information.
4. The system should remember the metadata entered by the depositor in previous deposits, so that it can be pre-filled in the appropriate fields whenever the depositor starts a new deposit.
5. The pre-filled metadata should be editable in case the depositor wants to make changes or updates.
6. The system should provide clear and intuitive fields for the depositor to view and confirm the pre-filled metadata before submitting the deposit.
7. The metadata filling and remembering functionality should be secure and comply with any privacy and data protection regulations.
8. The system should handle and display the retrieved metadata correctly, ensuring accuracy and consistency.
9. Perform testing for retrieving metadata from different University systems, ensuring that it works seamlessly without any errors or disruptions.
10. The system should provide a mechanism to refresh or update the retrieved metadata in case there are changes or updates in the University systems.
