User Story: 
As a depositor, I want to allow my collaborators privileged access to datasets, so that we continue to have a productive relationship.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #1)
1. The system should allow depositors to add collaborators to their datasets.
2. Collaborators should be able to access and view the datasets shared with them by the depositor.
3. The system should provide the ability for depositors to set different levels of access privilege for each collaborator.
4. The system should send notifications to collaborators when they have been added to a dataset by a depositor.
5. Depositers should be able to revoke access privileges for any collaborator at any time.
6. Collaborators should no longer be able to access a dataset after their access privileges have been revoked by the depositor.
7. The system should provide a log of all access activity for each dataset, including when collaborators were added or removed.
8. Depositers should be able to easily manage their list of collaborators and their access privileges.
9. The system should enforce secure authentication measures to ensure that only authorized collaborators can access the datasets.
10. The system should prevent collaborators from modifying or deleting datasets without appropriate access privileges.
11. When a collaborator attempts to access a dataset they do not have access to, the system should display an appropriate access denied message.
12. The system should enforce strong password requirements for all user accounts, including depositors and collaborators.
13. The system should automatically expire access privileges for collaborators if they have not been active for a certain period of time.
14. The system should provide a way for depositors to easily track and manage access requests from potential collaborators.
15. Collaborators should be able to request access to a dataset if they have previously been denied access.
16. Collaborators should receive notifications when their access privileges for a dataset are modified by the depositor.
17. There should be a release plan for the implementation of this feature to ensure timely delivery.
18. The budget for implementing this feature should be reviewed and approved by the appropriate stakeholders.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #2)
1. The depositor should be able to invite collaborators to access the datasets.
2. The depositor should have the ability to define the level of access privileges for each collaborator, such as read-only, read-write, or admin access.
3. The system should send an invitation email to the collaborator with a unique link to accept the invitation and create an account if necessary.
4. Collaborators should be able to log in with their credentials and access the datasets based on the assigned access privileges.
5. The depositor should have the capability to revoke or modify access privileges for collaborators at any time.
6. The system should provide a log or audit trail to track the changes in access privileges for collaborators.
7. Collaborators should be able to navigate and search for datasets easily within their assigned access privileges.
8. The system should ensure that data security and privacy measures are in place to protect the datasets from unauthorized access.
9. The system should enforce strong password requirements and provide a secure mechanism for password resetting and account recovery.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #3)
1. The depositor should have the ability to grant access to specific datasets to selected collaborators.
2. The system should provide a user interface for the depositor to manage and modify the privileges of the collaborators.
3. The depositor should be able to assign different levels of access privileges to the collaborators, such as read-only access or read-write access.
4. The collaborators should receive notifications or alerts when their access privileges are modified or when new datasets are shared with them.
5. The system should enforce access control measures to prevent unauthorized access to datasets by collaborators.
6. The system should provide the option for granular permission settings, allowing the depositor to define access at the file or folder level.
7. The system should have a backup and recovery mechanism in place to protect the datasets in case of accidental loss or corruption.
8. The system should have the ability to revoke access privileges for a collaborator if necessary.
9. The system should allow the depositor to set restrictions on specific datasets, such as restricting access based on time or location.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #4)
1. The system should provide a feature to allow the depositor to grant privileged access to datasets to their collaborators.
2. The items that can be granted privileged access should be clearly identified and selectable by the depositor.
3. The system should provide the option to grant different levels of privileged access, such as read-only or read-write access, for each dataset.
4. The collaborators should receive a notification or invitation to access the dataset once privileged access has been granted.
5. The system should provide a secure mechanism for the collaborators to authenticate and access the dataset.
6. The system should track and log the actions of the collaborators on the dataset, such as modifications or downloads.
7. The depositor should be able to revoke or modify the privileged access of the collaborators at any time.
8. The system should enforce appropriate data security measures, such as encryption, to protect the dataset from unauthorized access or breaches.
9. The system should have mechanisms in place to handle any conflicts or concurrency issues that may arise when multiple collaborators have access to the same dataset.
10. The system should provide an option for the depositor to set an expiration date for the privileged access, after which the access will be automatically revoked.
