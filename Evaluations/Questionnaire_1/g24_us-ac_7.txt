4. The system should provide a secure storage environment to protect the data from unauthorized modifications or deletions.
5. The system should comply with industry standards and best practices for data integrity and archival requirements.
6. The system should have automated tests in place to verify the data integrity measures and ensure that they are working as intended.
7. The system should have a release plan in place to ensure timely updates and enhancements to the data integrity features.
8. The system should have a budget allocation for maintaining and enhancing the data integrity features.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #2)
1. The system should ensure the accuracy and consistency of the deposited data throughout its lifecycle, from entry to retrieval.
2. The system should provide mechanisms to prevent unauthorized modifications, deletions, or tampering of the deposited data.
3. The system should have regular data backup and restoration procedures in place to maintain data integrity and availability in case of system failures.
4. The system should have appropriate access controls to restrict access to the deposited data only to authorized users.
5. The system should support data validation to ensure that only valid and complete data is accepted for deposit.
6. The system should allow for the export of deposited data in standard formats (e.g., CSV, XML, JSON) to facilitate data retrieval and use in the future.
7. The system should provide clear documentation and guidance for depositors on data integrity practices and requirements.
8. The system should provide evidence of data integrity measures taken to fulfill funder requirements for archival.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #3)
1. All data stored in the system should be protected against accidental loss, corruption, or unauthorized modification.
2. The system should provide mechanisms to ensure the integrity of data during storage, transmission, and retrieval processes.
3. Data backups should be performed regularly to enable data recovery in case of any failures or disasters.
4. The system should implement access controls to prevent unauthorized access or modifications to the data.
5. The system should have a version control mechanism to track and manage changes made to the data over time.
6. The system should comply with industry standards and best practices for data integrity and archival, such as checksum verification and long-term data preservation.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #4)
1. The system should ensure the integrity of the depositor's data by implementing appropriate backup mechanisms.
2. The system should regularly perform data backups to protect against data loss or corruption.
3. The backups should be stored securely in multiple physical or cloud locations to prevent loss of data in the event of a catastrophic incident.
4. The system should maintain a log of all data changes to track any modifications made to the depositor's data.
5. The system should implement access controls and permission levels to ensure that only authorized individuals can modify or delete deposited data.
6. The system should provide a verification mechanism to validate the integrity of the data, such as checksums or digital signatures.
7. The system should comply with industry standards and best practices for data integrity and archival, such as the OAIS (Open Archival Information System) reference model.
8. The system should provide documentation and evidence to demonstrate compliance with funder requirements for data archival.
9. The system should have a clear and transparent data retention policy, specifying how long the data will be stored and when it will be deleted or archived.
