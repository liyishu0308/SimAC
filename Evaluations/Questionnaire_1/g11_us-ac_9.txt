User Story: 
As a developer, I want to know what the three initial hypotheses are, so that I can plan work around development of prototypes.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #1)
1. The user story should include three initial hypotheses for development of prototypes.
2. The initial hypotheses should be clearly stated and measurable.
3. The initial hypotheses should be relevant to the goal of the development.
4. The acceptance criteria should be testable by validating whether the user story includes three initial hypotheses or not.
5. The acceptance criteria should include failure cases, such as if the user story does not include three initial hypotheses.
6. [Others] The user story should include a release plan or release items for the development of prototypes.
7. [Others] The user story should include code management requirements for the development of prototypes.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #2)
1. The user should be able to access the three initial hypotheses through a project management tool or document shared with the development team.
2. Each hypothesis should include a clear problem statement, proposed solution, and expected outcome.
3. The initial hypotheses should be reviewed and approved by stakeholders or the product owner before development work begins.
4. The initial hypotheses should be prioritized based on their potential impact and feasibility, to guide the development team in planning work and resources allocation.
5. The project management tool or document should track the progress of development work related to each hypothesis, such as completed tasks, pending tasks, and issues encountered.
6. The project management tool or document should allow for updates or revisions to the initial hypotheses, in case there are changes or new information that may affect the development process.
7. The project management tool or document should clearly indicate the timeline or deadline for completing the development of prototypes based on the initial hypotheses.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #3)
1. The three initial hypotheses should be clearly documented and easily accessible to the developers.
2. The documented hypotheses should include a clear description of each hypothesis, including the problem statement, proposed solution, and expected outcomes.
3. The documented hypotheses should be written in a way that is easily understandable by the development team, using clear and concise language.
4. The hypotheses should be prioritized based on their importance and potential impact.
5. The documentation should be regularly updated to reflect any changes or updates to the hypotheses.
6. The development team should be able to access the documentation from a central repository or knowledge base.
7. The documentation should include any supporting research or data that led to the formulation of the hypotheses.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #4)
1. The three initial hypotheses should be clearly documented and easily accessible to the developer.
2. The initial hypotheses should be defined in a concise and understandable format that provides clear direction for development.
3. The initial hypotheses should be validated by relevant stakeholders and align with the project's goals and objectives.
4. The initial hypotheses should be prioritized based on their expected impact and feasibility for development.
5. The initial hypotheses should be regularly reviewed and updated as necessary throughout the project lifecycle.
6. The developer should have access to any supporting documentation or research that informed the development of the initial hypotheses.
7. The initial hypotheses should include specific success criteria or measurements to determine their validity and impact.
8. The initial hypotheses should be accompanied by a timeline or roadmap indicating when prototypes are expected to be developed and tested.
9. The developer should be provided with the necessary resources, tools, and infrastructure to efficiently develop the prototypes and conduct the necessary tests.
