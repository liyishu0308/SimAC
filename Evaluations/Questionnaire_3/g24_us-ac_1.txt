User Story: 
As an academicpublisher, I want to make persistent web links between my articles and underlying datasets, so that my journals can be seen to be filled with robust, high quality research. 

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #1)
1. The system should provide a feature to create persistent web links between articles and underlying datasets.
2. The persistent web links should be generated automatically and remain consistent even if the location of the dataset changes.
3. The persistent web links should be publicly accessible and should not require any login or authentication.
4. The persistent web links should be associated with the specific article and dataset, ensuring accurate linking between the two.
5. The persistent web links should be easily shareable and should be compatible with various communication channels (e.g., email, social media).
6. The persistent web links should be visually distinguishable from regular hyperlinks to clearly indicate their purpose.
7. The persistent web links should be supported by a reliable hosting infrastructure to ensure continuous availability and access.
8. The persistent web links should be compatible across different devices, operating systems, and web browsers.
9. The system should track and record usage statistics of the persistent web links to provide analytics on the popularity and impact of the articles and datasets.
10. The persistent web links should be encrypted and secure to protect sensitive information and maintain data integrity.
11. The system should support version management of the datasets to handle updates or changes without breaking the persistent web links.
