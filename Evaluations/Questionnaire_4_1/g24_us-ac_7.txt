User Story: 
As a depositor, I want to have guarantees about data integrity, so that I can use my data in the future and I can fulfil funder requirements for archival.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #1)
1. The system should ensure that all data stored in the application remains intact and unaltered over time.
2. The application should use established and reliable data storage technologies that provide data integrity guarantees, such as checksums or cryptographic hashes.
3. When data is retrieved from storage, the system should verify its integrity using the established integrity mechanisms.
4. The application should have regular backup procedures in place to protect against data loss or corruption.
5. The system should have appropriate error handling and notification mechanisms in case of data integrity failures.
6. The application should provide an audit trail or logs that capture any modifications or changes made to the data, along with timestamps and user information.
7. The system should have appropriate access controls and permission settings to prevent unauthorized modifications to the data.
8. The application should comply with industry-standard data archival practices and guidelines to meet funder requirements for long-term data preservation.
9. The system should have a data restoration process in place to ensure that previous versions of data can be recovered if needed.
10. Regular integrity checks or audits should be performed on the stored data to identify and rectify any potential integrity issues.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #2)
1. All data stored in the system should be protected against accidental loss, corruption, or unauthorized modification.
2. The system should provide mechanisms to ensure the integrity of data during storage, transmission, and retrieval processes.
3. Data backups should be performed regularly to enable data recovery in case of any failures or disasters.
4. The system should implement access controls to prevent unauthorized access or modifications to the data.
5. The system should have a version control mechanism to track and manage changes made to the data over time.
6. The system should comply with industry standards and best practices for data integrity and archival, such as checksum verification and long-term data preservation.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #3)
1. The system should store the data in a secure and reliable storage system.
2. Data should be backed up regularly in order to prevent data loss in case of system failure.
3. Data should be encrypted while stored and in transit.
4. Data should be accessible only with the proper authentication credentials.
5. The system should provide an audit trail for all data access and modification activities.
6. The system should have a version control system for data to ensure data integrity.
7. The system should provide a way to restore data to a previous version if necessary.

Acceptance Criteria (generated from Model #4)
1. Data should be stored in a secure format, such as encrypted files.
2. Data should be backed up regularly and stored on a separate system from the main system.
3. Data should be stored in accordance with the relevant data laws and regulations.
4. Data should be stored in a way that allows for easy retrieval and access.
5. The system should have a data integrity check mechanism to ensure data accuracy and completeness.
6. Data should be stored in a way that allows for quick recovery in case of system failure or data corruption.
7. The system should have a logging system to track user activities.
8. The system should have a mechanism to ensure data is not tampered with or modified without authorization.
